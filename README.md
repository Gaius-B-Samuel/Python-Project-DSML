# Python-Project-DSML
# Employee Data Analysis Project

- Overview

This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights about the workforce, including team distribution, salary expenditure, and age demographics. The project includes data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

# Preprocessing Steps

- Correcting the "height" Column: The height values were replaced with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.
- Handling Missing Values: Checked and managed any missing values in the dataset.
- Ensuring Data Integrity: Verified consistency of data types and categorical variables before analysis.

# Analysis Tasks and Findings

- Distribution of Employees Across Teams:
Calculated the number and percentage of employees per team.
Identified the teams with the highest and lowest workforce representation.

- Segregation of Employees Based on Position:
Counted the number of employees in each position within the company.
Identified key positions with the highest workforce representation.

- Predominant Age Group Among Employees:
Grouped employees into age categories (20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60).
Identified the most common age group among employees.

- Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure:
Calculated total salary expenditure by team and position.
Determined which team and job role had the highest payroll costs.

- Correlation Between Age and Salary:
Analyzed if employee salary increases with age.
Used scatter plots to visualize the relationship.

# Graphical Representations

Bar Charts: Used to visualize employee distribution across teams and positions.
Histograms: Displayed the predominant age group of employees.
Scatter Plot: Showed a correlation between age and salary.
Salary Expenditure Charts: Bar charts illustrating which teams and positions have the highest payroll costs.

# Insights Gained

Certain teams have a significantly higher workforce compared to others.
Specific job positions dominate the companyâ€™s structure.
The majority of employees belong to a particular age group.
Salary expenditure is unevenly distributed across teams and positions.
A possible correlation exists between age and salary, indicating experience-based compensation trends.

# Additional Information

The dataset has been processed and saved as processed_employee_data.csv.
All analysis and visualizations were performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The project is structured in a Jupyter Notebook format for easy reproducibility.
